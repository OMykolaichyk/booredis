Description
-----------
  Booredis is an asyncronous boost::asio-based Redis client library.
  It's main purpose is simplicity. You don't have to worry about almost
  nothing: it's very easy to use.

  For now due to it's async nature it's not very usable to get values from
  Redis, but it's very convenient way to use for setting values and subscribing.
